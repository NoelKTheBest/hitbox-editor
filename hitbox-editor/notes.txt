We will be creating a new scene with a Sprite2D node,
an AnimationPlayer, and as many Area2D nodes as the animation
requires. This will also allow users to copy and paste or
instantiate these scenes in other scenes. 

This method will save settings for only one animation 
unfortunately. To get around this, I should keep the 
current/editing scene in memory until I decide to save and
load a new scene to work with. The extra container will 
only be open for adding hitboxes to the current
animation and once it's finished, it will go back to the main
screen.

In this main screen, I can load and/or select other 
animations or even an animation library. If I load another
library, that will effectively be it's own scene. The current
"*unsaved" library will be part of it's own scene that will 
keep getting updated with animations that have a hitbox or 
hurtbox added to them.
